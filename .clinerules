# AI Assistant Rules for Binectics Frontend

## Primary Reference Document

**ALWAYS read and reference `Claude.MD` before making any design, component, or architectural decisions.**

Claude.MD contains:

- Design system (Blinkist-inspired colors, typography)
- Component patterns and standards
- Completed features and sections
- Backend data models and types
- PRD requirements and specifications

## Design System (from Claude.MD)

- Colors: Use exact Blinkist palette defined in Claude.MD
- Typography: Cera Pro font family
- Components: Follow existing patterns in src/components
- Dark text on colored backgrounds (including green, yellow)
- No button animations (only hover/active states)
- Card-based layouts with generous padding

## Code Standards

- UI Components: Use named exports (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
- Page/Layout Components: Use default exports
- TypeScript: Strict mode, always type component props
- Imports: Use `@/components` and `@/lib` aliases
- File naming: PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities

## Import Order

1. React imports
2. Third-party libraries
3. Internal components (@/components)
4. Internal utilities (@/lib)
5. Styles/CSS

## Before Building Features

1. Check Claude.MD for existing patterns
2. Verify color palette matches Blinkist design
3. Ensure component exports follow project standards
4. Use TypeScript with proper typing
5. Follow established folder structure

## Project Structure

- `src/app/` - Next.js pages and routes
- `src/components/` - All React components
- `src/lib/` - Constants, types, utilities
- `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks

## When in Doubt

**Reference Claude.MD first** - it's the single source of truth for this project.
